Â Assignment 7
Implement binary SVM to classify MNIST digits 3 and 8 using SMO Algorithm. Use different kernel functions(RBF, Polynomial at least) and generate ROC curve. Strictly divide(60:20:20) the data into train, validation and test splits. Perform all hyper parameter tuning/feature selection on validation data and report accuracy on test split. We suggest you to implement the SMO algorithm by yourself for which 10 bonus points will be given, but if you find it difficult, you are free to use third party implementation".
